# TensorSketch

TensorSketch is a lightweight deep learning library for tensorflow 2.0. Its goal
is to be a simple deep learning library that brings together some of the
conveniences of both PyTorch and Keras. If you are accustomed to the lifecycle
of a basic PyTorch-based project and want an easy way to jump into using
TensorFlow, then this library is for you :-)

## Installation

```
pip install tensorsketch
```

Can be used with both TF 1.0 (with v2 enabled) and TF 2.0.

## Demonstration

A demonstration of tensorsketch can be found in this
[codebase](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/weak_disentangle).
