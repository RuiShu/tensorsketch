# TensorSketch

TensorSketch is a lightweight deep learning library for tensorflow 2.0. Its goal
is to be a lightweight TensorFlow deep learning library that brings together
some of the conveniences of both PyTorch and Keras. If you are accustomed to the
lifecycle of a typical PyTorch-based project and want an easy way to jump into
using TensorFlow, then this library is for you :-)
