# TensorSketch

TensorSketch is a lightweight deep learning library for tensorflow 2.0. Its goal
is to be a simple deep learning library that brings together some of the
conveniences of both PyTorch and Keras. If you are accustomed to the lifecycle
of a basic PyTorch-based project and want an easy way to jump into using
TensorFlow, then this library is for you :-)
